Hey👋 there🙂. Thank you 🙏🏼 for stopping by

My name is Justus Dahunsi, I'm a versatile DevOps engineer with a love for Quality. 
Proficient in a wide range of tools and technologies. Possesses a results-driven attitude that is supported
by practical experience driving the development and support of AWS systems and in-depth knowledge of
Azure services. Experienced in managing and optimizing key components of the DevOps ecosystem,
such as version control systems like Git (GitHub, BitBucket), continuous integration and deployment
pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline), and container orchestration platforms (AWS
EKS, AWS ECS, Kubernetes). Skilled in configuring and deploying various web servers (Nginx, Apache)
and leveraging infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform and CloudFormation for streamlined
deployments. Proficient in working with databases including MongoDB, MySQL, and DynamoDB,
ensuring data integrity and high availability. Skilled in Agile SCRUM and Scrum development
methodologies, collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software
solutions. Strong problem-solving and analytical skills, with a focus on continuous improvement and
automation to optimize workflows and increase efficiency. Overall, a dedicated and results-driven DevOps engineer with a deep understanding of software development lifecycles and a passion for creating robust and scalable infrastructure solutions. Ready to contribute expertise, leadership, and technical excellence to drive successful project outcomes.

One thing that makes me stand out is not just my attention to detail, and also my view that whatever is seen as the best can always be better. 

I'm a lover of tech and that has influenced me so much that I try to explore areas that help me to see beyond the present scene. The fact that Technology is so diverse and evolving, allows me to see opportunity in every situation. For Instance, imagining how technology will influence the world in the next 15 to 25 years now determines my approach to doing things now. Although never stop learning and Innovating, technology is often the solution to problems in this modern world. With my knowledge and experience, I've been able to understand that "Impossibilities are Possibilities that have not yet been explored".
