Hey👋 there🙂. Thank you 🙏🏼 for stopping by

Hi, I’m Justus Dahunsi, I'm a QA engineer with a love for Quality. 
One thing that has made me stand out is not just my attention to detail, 
but also my view that whatever is seen as the best can always be better. 

I'm a lover of tech and that has influenced me so much that I try to explore areas which help me to see beyond the present scene.
 The fact that Technology is so diverse and evolving, allows me to see opportunity in every situation. For Instance, imagining how 
technology will influence the world in the next 15 to 25 years now determines my approach to doing things now. 
Although never stop learning and Innovating, technology is often the solution to problems in this modern world. 
With my knowledge and experience, I've been able to understand that
 "Impossibilities are Possibilities that have not yet been explored".

- 👀 I’m interested in innovative tech news
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Selenium and also improving my devops skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any start-up of interest
